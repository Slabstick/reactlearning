#freeCodeCamp React Course

##05/17/22

I started this new repo because I'm taking time off of codecademy to repeat some of the intermediate react lessons in another form. Here I found this 12 hour long video on youtube that has a lot of lessons to code alongside with it so I'll be doing exactly that in this here repository.

Hopefully I'll be able to understand the underlying logic a little bit more once I'm done with it but that's my plan for the next week after taking 2, 3 days off to clear my head a little bit.
